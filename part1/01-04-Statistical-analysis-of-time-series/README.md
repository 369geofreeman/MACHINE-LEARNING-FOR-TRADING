# Statistical analysis of time series


## Lesson outline

**Pandas makes it very convenient to compute various statistics on a dataframe:**

* Global statistics: mean, median, std, sum, etc. [more]
* Rolling statistics: rolling_mean, rolling_std, etc. [more]
* You will use these functions to analyze stock movement over time.

**Specifically, you will compute:**

* Bollinger Bands: A way of quantifying how far stock price has deviated from some norm.
* Daily returns: Day-to-day change in stock price.
